# MindYourTask

## App Overview

**Background:** The research field of `decision-making and learning` in Humans typically uses experimentation performed in a closed-room setting, generally at the team/lab's office, on a monitor/PC.
These experiments typically consist of some stimuli presented on the screen to the subject, requiring them to perform an action in response to the stimuli. 
Optionally, a feedback follows to the subject's response. Depending on the research question, this process repeats for multiple `trials` in a `session` and possibly across multiple `sessions`.
Most importantly, this way of experimentation requires the subject to turn up in-person to the site of experimentation and spend uninterrupted time performing the experiment.

**Purpose:** __MindYourTask__ is a mobile app, particularly focussing on 3 specific tasks in the field of `perceptual decision-making`.
The notable aspects of __MindYourTask__, in contrast with the traditional experimentation, are:

    - Native Mobile App (iOS/Android) on Subject's personal devices
    - Experiment tasks will be adapted such that they will be performed in shorter timescales (couple of minutes), multiple times a day, across multiple days
    - Subjects choose to open the app and perform the tasks whenever they please - in certain time windows (for e.g: once in the morning, once in the afternoon and once in the evening)
    - Responses/Choices such as `Left` and `Right`, which would normally be presented as buttons on a screen to be clicked, would be recording by swipes on the mobile screen


**Target Audience:** General Public - for reasonable uniformity, university students, working professionals of an age group window (say 18-40 ?)

**Platform:** Developed in `react-native` built for `iOS` and `android`
