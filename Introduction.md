# MindYourTask

Mind Your Task is a citizen-science app, primarily focussed on conducting simple experiments with mobile users. 

The general interest of the 'Mind Your Task" project is to bring the experimentation in the field of "decision-making" and "learning" in neuroscience from lab setting to mobiles.

The app hosts multiple 'Tasks' where each Task screen has multiple phases such as 'resting', 'stimulus', 'response', 'feedback' etc.
